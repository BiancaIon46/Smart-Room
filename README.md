# Smart-Room

This project is a prototype of a smart room. 

The room counts how many people are getting in and starts the fan when there are more than 2 people inside (the fan stops when there are less than 2 people inside).

Information about the total number of people who entered the room and about the temperature are being displayed on the LCD.

The room has an automated door system and light system and multiple sensors: temperature sensor, CO gas sensor, fire sensor, and earthquake sensor. When a sensor measures an abnormal value, an alarm starts and information about the danger is displayed on the LCD. 

The 2 Arduino boards communicate through Bluetooth connection.
