# Smart-Room

This project is a prototype of a smart room. 

The room counts how many people are getting in and starts the fan when there are more than 2 people inside (the fan stops when there are less than 2 people inside).

The room has an automated door system and light system and multiple sensors: CO gas sensor, fire sensor, and earthquake sensor. When a sensor measures an abnormal value, an alarm starts and information about the danger is displayed on the LCD. 

The 2 Arduino boards communicate through Bluetooth connection.
